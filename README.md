# The dawn of Otrozhny

A game made in python for my high school culminating activity in 2018.

I made this game over the course of about 2 months, and I wasn't very knowledgeable about python at the time, so the code is pretty messy.

- Stealth mechanics
- Backstory
- Sound effects

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
